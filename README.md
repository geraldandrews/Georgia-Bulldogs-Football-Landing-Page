## Description:
I was inspired to create this landing page because of my interest in college football. I created and designed this landing page from scratch using HTML and CSS for the layout and responsiveness of the landing page, CSS animations for the fade in effect in the header and the Animate On Scroll(AOS) library which allows for the animation of the images and other elements on the landing page.
